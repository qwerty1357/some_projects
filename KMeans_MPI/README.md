# KMeans algorithm

KMeans algorithm implemented in C with MPI.

Run in folder where are files for every process and '0.in' file which stores init centroids.

## Run:
./run.sh <number_of_processes> <number_of_centroids>

To change 'user dimension' modify in metrics.h

## Output:
<user_id> <coord_1> <coord_2> ... <numb_of_centroid>
